# Pamplona

> In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.

**NOTE:** This is still in active development.

Pamplona is my personal workspace built to always be accessible on any fresh
Ubuntu install I need. It assumes Debian-based systems and is very much a
personalized experience for myself.

SaltStack is the underlying build tool and a Vagrant box is added to test the
formulas.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo or download the files locally. There are two scripts that can
manage all of the salt work needed:

- bin/boostrap: For installing a salt minion and configuring it
- bin/update: For updating the pillars and states and running highstate

You can run `./bin/update` and it will run the bootstrap script as well.

## Using Vagrant

There isn't a lot of use for these states and Vagrant as a server. If you're
building a virtualbox to work in though it should be helpful. Running `vagrant
up` will get everything set up for you. Subsequent vagrant ups will call the
highstate and update the states on the system.

## Requirements still to do

- [ ] vundle
- [ ] mysql
- [ ] dotfiles
- [ ] (maybe) private-internet-access (https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/installer/install_ubuntu.sh)

## Todo

- [ ] Find out if salt-call can show progress on a masterless minion
- [ ] Add environments to top files and server dependencies so I can make pamplona desktops and servers
- [ ] More comprehensive README
