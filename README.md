# Pamplona

> In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.

**NOTE:** This is still in active development.

Pamplona is my personal workspace built to always be accessible on any fresh
Ubuntu install I need. It assumes Debian-based systems and is very much a
personalized experience for myself.

SaltStack is the underlying build tool and a Vagrant box is added to test the
formulas.

## Philosophy

There are a lot of ways to handle desktop configurations from keeping dotfiles
to creating bash scripts to install dependencies. Configuration management
isn't just for the server though and I think it should be applied to your
personal desktop to keep dependencies controlled and easy to reproduce.

That's where Saltstack comes in.

By defining all of my applications and packages in Salt config files I can add
new packages and apply them to any minion in my Salt network. Salt has its
rough edges but when it comes to installing dependencies on servers and
communicating within a network of servers it really shines.

## Getting Started

By default there are scripts to manage your own personal desktop. This setup
installs a master and minion conifg on your computer allowing you to target the
desktop directly when making updates.

Clone this repo or download the files locally. There are two scripts that can
manage all of the salt work needed:

- bin/boostrap_desktop: For installing a salt minion and master and configuring them
- bin/update_desktop: For updating the pillars and states and running highstate

You can run `./bin/update_desktop` and it will run the bootstrap script as well.

To customize your experience you can edit the pillar data in `saltstack/pillar/data.sls`.
The current config is setup as follows:

```
hostname: pamplona
runas_user:
  username: dan
  full_name: Dan Sackett
core:
  locale: en_US
  timezone: 'America/New_York'
  users:

      full_name: Ubuntu
  install_apt_packages:
    - build-essential
    - libssl-dev
    - libffi-dev
    - libxml2-dev
    - curl
    - htop
    - sqlite3
    - libsqlite3-dev

    - virtualenv
    - vimplug
    - yarn
  install_pips:
    - todooo-cli
    - bpython
  install_node_modules:
    - create-react-app
  configure_apps:
    git:
      user:
        name: Dan Sackett
        email: danesackett@gmail.com
      editor: vim
      merge_tool: meld
    ruby:
      default: 2.3.0
      install_versions:
        - 2.3.0
```

There are two phases to the desktop configuration: **core** and **apps**. The
core setup handles hostname, users, and apt packages for you. The apps setup
handles any third-party applications you want to install. Some relevant
definitions:

### hostname

The hostname gives the machine its hostname like you would expect.

### runas_user

The runas_user defines the user which will run commands in the state files.
This should be your current username on the machine you're setting up.

### core.locale

The locale defines the locale for the machine. It defaults to `en_US`.

### core.timezone

The timezone sets the timezone for the machine. It defaults to `'America/New_York'`.

### core.users

The users data defines any additional users you want to add to the system. They
will all be created and given a home directory with SSH keys generated for
each. You do not need to include the runas_user in this definition since we
already ensure they are included.

Users should be in the form:

```
USERNAME:
  full_name: FULLNAME
```

### core.install_apt_packages

The install_apt_packages setting allows you to set any packages you want to
install through apt-get. Each will be added to the machine.

### apps.install_apps

The install_apps setting defines the states to run. The current states
available are:

```
docker
git
google-chrome.sl
mumble
node
numix
postfix
postgres
python
redis
rvm
shutter
spotify
vagrant
virtualbox
virtualenv
yarn
```

Defining any of these will install the application for you.

### apps.install_pips

The install_pips setting defines any pip packages to be installed globally.

### apps.install_node_modules

The install_node_modules setting defines any NPM packages to be installed globally.

### apps.install_gems

The install_gems setting defines any ruby gems to be installed through RVM.

### apps.configure_apps.git

The git setting under configure_apps allows you to define your default it
config values including username, email, editor, and diff tool.

### apps.configure_apps.ruby

The ruby setting under configure_apps allows you to define the default ruby to
set in RVM and any other versions you would like installed.

## Using Vagrant

There isn't a lot of use for these states and Vagrant as a server. If you're
building a virtualbox to work in though it should be helpful. Running `vagrant
up` will get everything set up for you. Subsequent vagrant ups will call the
highstate and update the states on the system.

## Requirements still to do

- [ ] mysql

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out the best way to show progress other than debug (reactor, returner, etc)
